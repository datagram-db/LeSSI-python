## What was LeSSI?

It was a pun from "I read (past)", "(to be) boiled", and how Lassie (dog) is pronounced, all in Italian.
In other words, this was a patchy Python pipeline orchestrating multiple services. Please refer to  [LaSSI project](https://github.com/datagram-db/LaSSI-pipeline) for a more cohesive framework: this repository is kept as it was the foundational basis for the first version of the pipeline as narrated in the following paper:
