## What is LeSSI?

It is a pun from "I read (past)", "(to be) boiled", and how Lassie (dog) is pronounced, all in Italian.
In other words, this is the main Python component for the overall [LaSSI project](https://github.com/datagram-db/LaSSI-pipeline): please refer to this repository for the entire ecosystem, which is the main contact point for the following paper: [TBA].
